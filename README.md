## Thee Bart, Thee

Experimenting with procedural generation of ui's for another project I'm cooking. 
Uses some custom code for writing responsive media query styles inline in react components. 
React, NextJS and styled components doing the heavy lifting.

## Page types to simulate

* docs 
* account page
* business dashboard

## Sections to simulate
* hero

* two-col section
* three-col section
* card
