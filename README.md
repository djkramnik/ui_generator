## Thee Bart, Thee

Experimenting with procedural generation of user interfaces, for another project I'm cooking. 
Uses some custom code for writing responsive media query styles inline in react components. 
React, NextJS and styled components doing the heavy lifting.

Avoid going overboard with hierarchies 

## Page types to simulate
dashboard:empty, search-results, video-page,
admin-page, 
lander:business, platform:login, platform:management, 
signup:flow, signup:payment, signup:confirmation, checkout-page, product-added page, 
sign in page, forgot password page, 
lander:ecommerce,

## Sections to simulate (provides context to components )

sidenav, navbar, hamburger menu, menu-section,
search-results, result-filters, title, description, 
profile, avatar, video-controls, recommends, comments, hero:video, 
nav-link, lander:section:marketing, lander:section:photo-collage, 
contact-form, footer, form:login, data-table, table-controls, modal:form,
card-option, modal:upload, list:links, marketing:carousel, secondary-nav, 
links-bar, product-metadata, report-issue/help, technical-details, 
disclaimer, legalese, customer-reviews, search-pane, product-confirmation, 
order summary, order item, order detail, radio group, button-options,
cookie-popup, popup, hero, tabs, removable-card, graph, filters, 

## Components (do not comment on context)

button:icon:labelled, button:icon:unlabelled, button:text:hasicon,
card, heading, copy, searchbar, logo, icon:hamburger, icon:settings,
category-filter, copy:metadata, media-preview, thumbnail, video-player, play, next, audio, 
button:option, icon:cc, card:expandable, media-metadata, comment, input, icon:like,
icon:dislike, button:text:no-outline, button:text, qr-code, image, grouped-info(?), 
address, social-icons, table-row, secondary-links, pagination, table-header 
dropdown, input:time, textarea, image-download, flow-progress-bar, 
input:cc-number,input:cc-expiry, input:cc-cvc, file-upload,
carousel, link, link:card, nav:dropdown, region:toggle, icon:cart, icon:right,
icon:left, search-result, price, accordion, rating, locale-switcher,
input:radio, input:checkbox, svg-decoration, {back to top (the literal text bro)},
menu-item:icon, button:toggle, 

component labels that are context-free, and those that have a different meaning placed in their section
or parent component.  i.e. a tab being just text context free, within the context of tabs it is a tab

what is actually needed for these workflows... 
you need not just the visual understanding but also semantic. 
ie. back to top bar with small centered font.  what the hell is that 


## Roadmap 
- [x] create script to extract all custom styles from a given element on page... for the purpose of grabbing mock assets for use in the simulator.
- [ ] create highly configurable versions of the above sections
- [ ] have templates for page types to simulate
- [ ] have script, or perhaps server side rendering logic to procedurally generate pages upon request
- [ ] for now just desktop width (1300x635). strictly non responsive. later on; generate for both mobile and desktop
