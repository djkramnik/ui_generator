## Roadmap 
- [x] create script to extract all custom styles from a given element on page... for the purpose of grabbing mock assets for use in the simulator.
- [ ] create highly configurable versions of the above sections
- [ ] have templates for page types to simulate
- [ ] have script, or perhaps server side rendering logic to procedurally generate pages upon request
- [ ] for now just desktop width. strictly non responsive. later on; generate for both mobile and desktop
